# Project Euler 50: https://projecteuler.net/problem=50
# The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes: 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 
# This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.
# The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
# Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

# There is a dynamic programming way to solve this program I believe. More search needed for a second possible solution.

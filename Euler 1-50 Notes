As of May 2020, I completed problems 1-50 Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/archives
These problems have created a strong foundation of learning rather than a lecture or videos.
If you are stuck on a problem or have any better ideas for improvement, email me at scott.schmidt1989@yahoo.com 
Here is a YouTube video link of detailed code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwXQlwfbQvg&t=809s

# Updates! Some problems now have better solutions:
# Problem 5 has new solution that solves problem in 3 seconds rather than 68 seconds. May 8, 2020
# Problem 35 has new solution that solves problem in under a second! Huge improvement from 100 seconds. May 10, 2020
# Problem 38 has new solution using 20 lines of code instead of 40. May 9, 2020.
# Problem 44 has new solution that solves in 1.4 seconds! Rather than 86 seconds. May 10, 2020
# Problem 47 has new solutin within 1.4 seconds until it finds the correct solution. May 9, 2020

# Here are ideas for improvement in the future:
# Problem 2: Dynamic programming method?
# Problem 14: Dynamic programming method?
# Problem 18: Need to confirm if there is no top-down approach?
# Problem 31: Try again sometime. Had to research answer. 
# Problem 32: Takes 40 lines of code.
# Problem 35: Solution takes 100 seconds. Too slow!
# Problem 37: Solution takes 43 seconds. Somewhat slow. 
# Problem 38: Takes 40 lines of code. Could be cleaner?
# Problem 44: Solution takes 86 seconds. Too slow!
# Problem 46: Dynamic programming method?
# Problem 47: Only finds right answer quickly if you plug in the function to search within the range.  
# Problem 50: Dynamic programming method?
